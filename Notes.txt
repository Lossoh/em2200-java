Convert IP unit tests from octal to assembler and mina them (in progress)

Lose unnecessary accessors (in progress)

minalib literal generation
minalib special mnemonics need attention (JGD, BT, etc)
minalib data generation - strings and floats
minalib float values - firm this up
minalib procs and functions
minalib functions

Finish adding instructions to IP

Recode disk (and maybe tape) devices using async IO

All Device objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Device.IoInfo objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Figure out how to do channel programs - more specifically, do we need a cleaner IO path?

minalib - finish up various functions and directives

Mina - wrapper around minalib

Exec - using Mina
