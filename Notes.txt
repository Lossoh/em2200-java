Convert IP unit tests from octal to assembler and mina them (in progress)

Lose unnecessary accessors (in progress)

minalib special mnemonics need attention (JGD, BT, etc)
minalib data generation - strings and floats
minalib float values - firm this up
minalib Think about how we do $LIT / expressions - using extraneous grouping symbols is a pain
minalib procs and functions
minalib functions
  $ILCN
  $L0
  $L1
  $LCB
  $LCFV
  $LCN
  $SSS
  $LCV
  $(n)
minalib directives
  $BASE
  $IF / $ELSE / $ELSF / $ENDF
  $DO / $ENDD
  $REPEAT / $ENDR
  $END
  $FORM
  $GEN
  $GFORM
  $INCLUDE
  $INFO (?)
  $LIT

Finish adding instructions to IP

Recode disk (and maybe tape) devices using async IO

All Device objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Device.IoInfo objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Figure out how to do channel programs - more specifically, do we need a cleaner IO path?

minalib - finish up various functions and directives

Mina - wrapper around minalib

Exec - using Mina
