Convert IP unit tests from octal to assembler and mina them (in progress)

Lose unnecessary accessors (in progress)

minalib - set up interrupt handlers for all tests - needs to be testable so we can assert on interrupt taken
minalib put directives into the system dictionary
minalib can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?
minalib make sure we don't propagate flagged attribute in any of the operators
minalib special mnemonics need attention (JGD, BT, etc)
minalib data generation - strings and floats
minalib float values - firm this up
minalib procs and functions
minalib functions
  $ILCN
  $L0
  $L1
  $LCB
  $LCFV
  $LCN
  $SSS
  $LCV
  $(n)
minalib directives
  $EQU
  $EQUF
  $USE (implicit base register)
  $INSERT
  $BASE (maybe)
  $IF / $ELSE / $ELSF / $ENDF
  $DO / $ENDD
  $REPEAT / $ENDR
  $END
  $FORM
  $GEN
  $GFORM
  $INCLUDE
  $INFO (?)
  $LIT (see special usage with base registers)

Finish adding instructions to IP

Recode disk (and maybe tape) devices using async IO

All Device objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Device.IoInfo objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

Figure out how to do channel programs - more specifically, do we need a cleaner IO path?

minalib - finish up various functions and directives

Mina - wrapper around minalib

Exec - using Mina
